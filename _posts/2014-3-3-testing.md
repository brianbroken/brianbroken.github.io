##What is a Gist?
There are many popular ways of organising, sorting and collecting resuable snippets of code. One popular approach is to store code snippets using [GitHubs Gists](https://gist.github.com). This a great tool for sharing and versioning code snippets however the interface can be limited. While pre-fixed terms (HTML / JS / CSS ) can be added to snippet descriptions to help search code, the visual separation or archived collection could be improved. 

##Why use Gistbox?


[Gistbox](http://www.gistboxapp.com/) solves this problem by introducing a brand new frontend that is directly connected with your Gist repository. This interface displays your gists within a clean, minimal interface that is both intuitive and simple to use.

1. **Labels** - Code can now be easily organised using colour coded labels based on relevant language, project or both. Snippets are easily browsed using left hand navigation bar. 

2. **Share and collaborate** – Code can be made public or private for personal use however it can also be shared amongst teams. This can be then used as a knowledge base for projects or code review amongst team members. 

3. **Colour coded syntax** – Snippets can be saved and viewed using a large variety of  different file types (javaScript, CSS, HTML) with syntax highlighting. 

4. **Chrome extension** - The [Clipper chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gistbox-clipper/cejmhmbmafamjegaebkjhnckhepgmido)   extends gistbox even further by making it quick and easy to save code snippets from webpages. This is expecially useful when browsing Stackoverflow answers and saving them inside your own library for future refrence.
