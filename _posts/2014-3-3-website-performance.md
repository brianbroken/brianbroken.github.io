We have recently been doing some work on website performance. Here is a short list of useful tools and websites to test your website performance:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

##Google page Speed

Google page Speed is an extremely useful tool to identity gaps in the performance of your website. It will advise you on how to optimise your site performance and best practices.

## Y-Slow

Y-slow is a plugin that you can combine with Firefbug to test and analyse your website. It will suggest ways to improve performance and will give you an idea of what java Script libraries or style sheets are weighing down your site giving you an overall score to improve on.
